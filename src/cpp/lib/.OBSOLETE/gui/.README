BUGS:
2020/03/25 Test/WormBuffer does not operate pixel-by-pixel any more.
         It used to. Now the WormBuffer updates a buffer at a time.
         This is the sort of thing that can happen when a project is ignored
         for years at a time.

2010/04/01 OS/BSD Cannot scroll to view entire window.

2010/04/01 OS/WIN Sample testBringup Window does not start at 600 x 600.

TODO:
2014/01/01 OS/WIN/WinDevice.*
         Debug::setIntensiveMode NOT COMPATIBLE
         Hang if application terminates while window size change in progress
           that results in scrolling.
         Running multiple instances, error 126 in DestroyWindow
           BYPASS: Ignore error
           Not exactly the problem? Scrolling causes the same error.

2010/04/29 BSD Font names can be found in /usr/share/fonts/*/fonts.dir
           First line is font count, remainder lines are font names.

2010/04/25 Do we want a buffer in the Text object, or a Text object that
           doesn't allocate storage, or a String data area in Text?

2010/04/25 Active events: Should there be one generic Active event that can
           handle most of the simple events? And another specifically for
           text input? Need to figure out how to handle drag and drop, and/or
           clipboard logic.

2010/04/25 Need some sort of FOCUS object.

2010/04/21 Experimental Layout Object, needs work. (Unused.)

2010/04/06 Should most of the action be in X11Thread rather than X11Device?
           (Have X11Device call the thread methods when needed.)
           Deferred.

2010/04/01 Add Draggable, Droppable attribute.
           (Do we need a Window::callback method?)
           Device invokes Window::callback
             (Screen updated -- no calls to device)
             (Returns change offset, length)
           Device invokes Device::change
           Deferred.

2010/04/01 Add line, poly, arc, and circle functions and objects.
           Maybe point  object (XYoffset).
           Maybe rectangle object (XYoffset, XYlength).
           Deferred.

2010/04/01 Verify Device::change, Device::expose functions do not
           exceed appropriate limits. OS/BSD, OS/WIN

2010/04/01 OS/WIN WinDevice cleanup.
           Why is color backwards? (0x00bbggrr, not 0x00rrggbb)
           Many junk/unused code segments.

2010/04/01 OS/WIN WormBuffer faster than OS/BSD.
           (Do we want to version Line.cpp USE_IMMEDIATE_CHANGE?)

STATUS:
2010/04/01 BSD: USE_X11THREAD does not work.
           There was a glitch which seems to have been caused by the
           interaction of X operations between the Device and the Thread.
           Now all X operations are protected by Mutex and the device,
           thread, and window seem to be quite happy with each other.

2010/04/01 Event notification is not working.
           A preliminary callback implementation has been built.
           The device (or thread) calls Windows::callback but cannot have
           any mutex held when it does. An active mouseover object was
           built (in Simple.cpp) that seems to behave OK. Object::locate
           had to be fixed, made virtual, and Bounds::locate added.
           Note that Windows::callback requires Object::locate (and cannot
           use Bounds::locate.)

##############################################################################
FIXED:
2010/04/01 OS/BSD, OS/WIN basic function verified.

2010/04/01 OS/BSD Resize does not work properly.
           Resize is handled by the window manager. We are told about
           resize events with Xlib ConfigureNotify

2010/04/01 OS/BSD Unable to close window without terminating program.
           Needed XInternAtom("WM_DELETE_WINDOW").

##############################################################################
HOWTO:
2010/04/01 OS/BSD: Compile with HCDM
           export OPTIMIZE="-g -DHCDM"

2010/04/01 OS/WIN: Compile with HCDM
           set OPTIMIZE=/Zi /DHCDM

2010/04/29 BSD Font names can be found in /usr/share/fonts/*/fonts.dir
           First line is font count, remainder lines are font names.
           Use XListFonts to find names programmatically.
           See sample: TextWorld.cpp
